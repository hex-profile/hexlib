What makes it difficult to use?

* Make config file less cluttered.
* CUDA Driver API layer is difficult; custom GPU compiler.
* Not exception-based, returns bool from each function (but code is generally exception-safe).
* stdBegin/stdEnd/stdPass function macros are unusual.
* Kits are unusual and badly supported by IDEs.
* Reallocation scheme with measure/execute phases is unusal.
