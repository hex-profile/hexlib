Test Module
===========

The test module is the `TestModule` API, which is defined in the `testModule.h` file.

A test module, unlike a simple hexlib GPU module, represents
a complete interactive test that interacts with a human.

The difference between a test module and a simple hexlib GPU module lies more in their purpose
and the type of usage, as well as the fact that there is a formally defined API for it.
It can also utilize slightly expanded tools.
