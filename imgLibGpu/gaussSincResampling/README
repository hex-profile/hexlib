The Gauss-sinc resampling module.

The resampling kernel used here is a sinc function shaped by a gaussian: 
baseKernel(x) = sinc(x) * gauss1(x, sigma).

Here:

sinc(x) = sin(pi*x) / (pi*x),
gauss1(x, sigma) = exp(-x^2 / sigma^2 / 2).

In frequency domain, this kernel is a box blurred by a gaussian.
(in frequency domain: the sinc is a box, the gauss is a gauss and multiplication becomes convolution).

For downsampling, the tradeoff between loosing resolution and having aliasing artifacts
is totally shifted to "no aliasing artifacts" side and such functions are named "conservative".

For this purpose, the kernel is scaled up by a "theta" parameter:
kernel(x) = baseKernel(x / theta) / theta.

The scaling up in spatial domain scales it down in frequency domain so that 
at the critical frequency the response is zero with almost 9 bits of accuracy.

Filters are computed in "gaussSincResampling.mws".

For upsampling, the theta is not needed, because the signal is already filtered well, 
so theta=1 is used and such functions are named "balanced".
