Gauss-sinc resampling module.

The resampling kernel used here is sinc shaped by gaussian: 
baseKernel(x) = sinc(x) * gauss1(x, sigma).

Here sinc(x) = sin(pi*x) / (pi*x),
gauss1(x, sigma) = exp(-x^2 / sigma^2 / 2).

In frequency domain, this kernel is box blurred by gaussian:
sinc in frequency domain is box, gauss in frequency domain is gauss and multiplication becomes convolution.

For downsampling functions, the tradeoff between loosing resolution and having aliasing artifacts
is totally shifted to "no aliasing artifacts" side and such functions are named "conservative".

For this purpose, the kernel is scaled up by "theta" parameter:
kernel(x) = baseKernel(x / theta) / theta.

The scaling up in spatial domain scales it down in frequency domain so that 
at the critical frequency the response is zero with almost 9 bits of accuracy.

Filters are computed in "gaussSincResampling.mws".

For upsampling functions, this is not important, because the signal is already filtered well, 
so theta=1 is used and such functions are named "balanced".
