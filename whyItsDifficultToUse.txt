What makes it difficult to use for other people?

* CUDA Driver API layer is difficult; custom GPU compiler.
* Not exception-based, returns bool from each function (but code is generally exception-safe).
* stdBegin/stdEnd/stdPass function macros are unusual.
* Kits are unusual and badly supported by IDEs.
* Reallocation scheme with measure/execute phases is non-standard.
